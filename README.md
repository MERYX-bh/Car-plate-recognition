<H1 align="center">Automatic Number Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLOv8</H1>

**Project description**

This mainly a license plate recognition based on deep learning.

- First we start by detecting the license plate then when detected, we make the characters recognitions.

plate detection : YOLOV8 

Characters recognition : EasyOCR

- Finally I deployed the model on a web app using Flask.


We start by detecting the license plate of the car like in the video below:
